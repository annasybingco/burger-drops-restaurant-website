# Burger Drops

## Overview

BurgerDrops is a Toronto-based, fast-casual restaurant that delivers quality smash burgers to its loyal patrons. Currently, they have a website available to them but are interested in expanding their company by creating an app.

### Problem Space

This app is to benefit a local small business owner. Currently, as they’re utilizing Uber Eats and Doordash, they must pay costly fees to keep their restaurant on the platform. They’re looking to create an app so that the company can retain their revenue, and align a bespoke app to their branding guidelines.
